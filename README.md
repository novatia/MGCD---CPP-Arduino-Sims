This example shows how to write code with C++11 and Arduino 2650 Board.
This is a test as part of C++ base course done by Daniele Colombo (Master in Computer Game Development 2019 Universit√† di Verona)

Board: Arduino 2650 
Shield used for the display: IDDB02 
Keypad: A generic 4x4 Matrix Keypad
LED: A common anode RGB Led (3x330Ohm Resistors)
Display : ITB02-2.8 8bit 320x240
PROTO SHIELD to assemble as stable as possible all this stuff.

The touch function was not added due to incompatible touch support. (is too old)

Libs used:
	UTFT by Rinky-Dink Electronics (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) can find in this repo
	Keypad by Mark Stanley (downloaded using Arduino IDE) 3.1.1
Arduino IDE Version: 1.8.9 (1.8.21.0)
